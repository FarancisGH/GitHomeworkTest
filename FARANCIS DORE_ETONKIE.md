*My favourite sport is football, I like football because I come from a country where football is our major sport. So i grew up playing and watching football.*

My favourite food is Fufu and Achu soup. I like it because it is one of our traditional meal which we praper it in traditional ceremony and specail days.

I am an enthusiastic nurse who has so much passion for tech. I want to learn tech so that i would help to implement it into the health sector and other. For example I would like to develop a program in which hospitals will use to communicate during patient referrals and continuity of care.
